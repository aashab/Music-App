Hello!

This is an incomplete project written in Python

I wanted to make a music player app where it will load the mp3 songs in your PC
and you listen to them directly through this program. You can register accounts
and then log into your account. All your account data will be saved in a database
in your python directory. I used SQlite3 for this. Initially there will be a 
blank profile picture, but you change it. You can also change your name. You can
also add songs to your personal playlist. Again all this information will be saved 
in your database, so none of them will be erased even after you restart the program

I know this program is very impractical. I am a complete beginner and just wanted
to make something that I was interested in. And as you can see, this code is very 
poorly written.

Once again, this is an incomplete project, I'm still working on it. However, if you want
you can change and add features yourself

Thank you,
Aashab Tajar
